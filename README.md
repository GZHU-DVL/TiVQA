Usage
---
First, you need to run Features extraction.py to extract content-dependency features and texture features. Note that you need to specify specific datasets and corresponding paths, where the default dataset is koNViD-1k .Then run TiVQA.py to test the results. Because the LSVQ dataset contains too many videos, the code is different from the other three datasets, and you need to run TiVQA_LSVQ.py to test the results.
